# Advanced-Tips-For-Content-Apps
This repo contains the fully working example code for the article about advanced tips for content apps that was written for Umbraco 24 days in 2021.

To get this repo up and running, clone it to your machine, open the project file in the IDE of your choice and build and run it (the project files are in the AdvancedContentApps folder). Once it's running, you can log into the back office by going to the back office on the /umbraco/ URL and then use the login `test@example.com` with a password of `Admin1234!!!`. There is a test CSV file that you can use to test the upload/import in the root of the repo.

To view the content app and test it, go to the blog page in the CMS and you should see the app there.

This code is provided as an example only.
